    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of salt & ½ teaspoon of black pepper to taste. Toss the beef in the
            flour
            mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat in a large frying pan or skillet. Add the beef and
            brown in
            batches, about 2 minutes per side. Place the beef in the bottom of a 6qt slow cooker.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat to medium and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add the onion and cook until tender.
            Add the
            onion to the slow cooker.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 1 cup of beef broth (or red wine per the recipe notes below) to the pan and scrape up any brown bits
            with a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the broth to the slow cooker along with the remaining 3 cups of broth, potatoes, carrots, celery,
            vegetable juice,
            Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, thyme, and ½ teaspoon of black pepper.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water. Stir into the stew a little bit at a time to thicken (you
            may not need
            all of the cornstarch mixture). Stir in peas.
