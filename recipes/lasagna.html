    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large pot of salted water, boil lasagna noodles until al dente according to
            package
            directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet or dutch oven, brown beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink
            remains.
            Drain any fat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black
            pepper. Simmer
            uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼
            teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓
            of the
            ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with
            remaining sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake
            for an
            additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.
